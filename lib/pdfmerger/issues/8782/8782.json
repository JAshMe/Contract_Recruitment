I wonder if the same package could exist for links",

Different from PDF document appending, which is processed by directly tagging the second PDF file to the target one, this [PDF file merging function](http://www.rasteredge.com/how-to/vb-net-imaging/pdf-merge/) will put the two target PDF together and save as new PDF, without changing the previous two PDF documents at all.
